Let's be honest. As a product manager, your to-do list is already miles long, and finding time to read books might seem like a luxury you can't afford. I get it. I've been there too. But before you dismiss the idea completely, let me share four books that have managed to change my perspective on product management and books in general. These aren't your typical run-of-the-mill, generic recommendations at the CEO or founder level like "Lean Product", "Hooked", "Launch" or "Ship it", No. these four books provide the kind of food for thought and actionable ideas that you can start thinking about, experimenting with, and implementing right away, regardless of the stage you are currently in your product management career.

### **"Product Management in Practice: A Real-World Guide to the Key Connective Role of the 21st Century"** by Matt LeMay:

Matt LeMay, in his book "Product Management in Practice," offers a refreshing take on product management. LeMay dives deep into the practical aspects of product management, providing real-world examples and strategies to implement.

> It can seem impossible to learn the nuances of day-to-day product work without doing it yourself. Matt LeMay weaves together case studies from experienced product mangers to help teach and reinforce key dimmensions of the role.

> What makes this unique is how it goes beyond the jargons and zeroes in on the practical challenges of product management, with super actionable tips. I was smiling and nodding as I read chapter after chapter.

**"Product Management in Practice"** serves as an invaluable resource for tackling the unpredictable nature of daily organizational tasks. Prior to reading this book, I was unaware of the extent of my own knowledge gaps, the pitfalls I was unknowingly succumbing to, and the vast amount of additional knowledge I needed to acquire.

The book is replete with practical anecdotes drawn from real-life experiences. I found myself relating to certain situations where I struggled to navigate effectively. By articulating these experiences and shedding light on the common traps associated with them, the book equiped me with the tools to handle similar challenges more adeptly in the future.

**Key Areas Touched upon:**

- Redefined CORE connective skills of Product Management (**C**ommunication, **O**rganization, **R**esearch, **E**xecution)
- Importance of Curiosity and Why Best Practices Suck
- Effective communication and stakeholder management
- Understanding Vision, Mission, Objectives, Roadmaps, Prioritization, Agile - all ambiguous terms that flow across a Product Organization, how they can have different meanings in different organizations and how a PM can navigate them.
- Understanding the power of user research and data
- Management vs Leadership in Product

### "Product Roadmaps Relaunched" by C. Todd Lombardo, Bruce McCarthy, and others

> It’s about time someone brought product roadmapping out of the dark ages of waterfall development and made it into the strategic communications tool it should be. McCarthy and team have cracked the code.

We've all seen those dreaded, outdated roadmaps that promise features set in stone. Lombardo and McCarthy's book, "Product Roadmaps Relaunched," challenges that approach and advocates for a more flexible, outcome-focused roadmap for the new age agile environment. They emphasize the need for product managers to engage stakeholders, prioritize ruthlessly, and communicate the ever-evolving nature of product development.

**Key Areas Touched upon:**

- A roadmap is a living document, not a contract. Embrace change and adaptability.
- The power of involving stakeholders throughout the roadmap process to ensure alignment.
- How to create outcome-based roadmaps that focus on customer value and business goals.
