Have you ever experienced **explanatory paralysis** when trying to explain [[Product Management]] to your parents, relatives, friends or just any person in General? We are in the same boat

It's understandable if your thoughts stall as you're forced to compress a highly nuanced role into something digestible for your audience.

Ironically, this exercise is part of the job: explaining an idea differently to various audiences (executives, department heads, stakeholders, customers, and engineers).

I've gathered some ideas for you to use.

While you can always say, _"I work with computers,"_ to escape the situation or, if you want to be enigmatic, _"You wouldn't believe me if I told you."_ But if you're in the mood to explain, here are some pointers.

**To Your Parents**

Let's start with the hardest one. They have the patience to listen to you, so let's take the liberty of framing it as a story.

Imagine Dad wants to cook lunch. Mom has strict instructions on using the utensils and equipment, and she's concerned things will go wrong. Grandma wants a specific dish, and your sister wants something else entirely.

So, I step in. I get everyone to agree on what to cook. I assure Mom that we'll follow her process and everything will be fine. I make the ingredients available and supervise from a distance to ensure her process is followed, keeping Grandma, Mom, and your sister updated on our progress.
Meanwhile, I help Dad get any resources he needs, making sure he doesn't face any bottlenecks.
When the dish is ready, I serve it, check that everyone is satisfied, and gather their feedback. If the feedback is good, everyone else takes the credit; if it's bad, it's all my fault.

Same thing I do at my organization, only that instead of cooking dish, it is building software, and just like in the case above, no one is answerable to me, but I am answerable to everyone.


**To that older relative** 
"You know Facebook and WhatsApp, right? Remember when you couldn't send stickers? A product manager figured out that users like you would enjoy that feature, so they had it built. I do the same kind of job for my company." 


**To engineers who haven't worked with PMs** 
"You know how you're constantly bombarded with new requests and urgent change orders? I act as a filter. I work with stakeholders and customers to prioritize what's important, protecting you from distractions so you can focus on building."


**To a anyone else in a corporate role** 
 "I tell the engineers what to build and leadership what we *won't* build. This helps us focus on improving the product to create more happy customers."
