Over the years, I have built products in messy real-world systems—FPnA teams wrestling with numbers, teachers grading at scale, mechanics fixing cars under pressure, or enterprise users navigating workflows. 

My strength lies in taking **chaotic environments**, understanding them end-to-end, and shaping them into products that are practical, technically sound, and actually used. 

I enjoy the unglamorous parts of product work and sometimes get lost in **data analysis**, **pattern-hunting**, and building small **internal tools** to speed up my own workflows. I like digging into the **users’ world** until their constraints make sense, and I’m at my best when those **insights quietly turn into features** that make someone’s day a little easier. 

The real satisfaction comes when users - unprompted- tell me the product actually **removed friction from their work.** and improved their life even if a little bit.
