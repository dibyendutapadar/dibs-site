Over the past decade, I’ve worked across diverse industries — automotive, EdTech, and enterprise AI — shaping products that bridge engineering depth with business clarity.

I’ve built platforms that scaled to millions of users, reduced operational overhead by thousands of hours, and helped enterprises turn data into tangible outcomes.

Each role has been an evolution:  
- From driving operational excellence at **Tata Motors**,  
- To launching digital after-sales systems at **Mahindra Auto Digitech**,  
- To shaping EdTech products at **Khan Academy** and **BYJU’S**,  
- To architecting AI-driven solutions at **Brane** and **Planful**.
