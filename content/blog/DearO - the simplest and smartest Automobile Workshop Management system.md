## Origin Story

In 2016, despite holding over 50% of the market share, the unauthorized car repair workshops relied on manual pen and paper processes. They failed to follow the digital trend, missing out on benefits that the taxis and food delivery industry was gaining. As a consequence, they were unable to provide their customers with an improved and transparent experience, and they also failed to optimize their daily operations by harnessing the power of technology.
