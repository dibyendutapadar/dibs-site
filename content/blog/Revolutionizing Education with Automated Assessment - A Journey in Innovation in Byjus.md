## My Role:

As a product manager, my role was multifaceted. I was not only the brainchild behind this initiative but also the driving force in its execution. My responsibility encompassed everything from conceptualization to overseeing the development and implementation of the tool.

  

## The Challenge: Overcoming Manual Overheads and Generic Assessments

The initial challenge was evident. Teachers within our system were burdened with the task of manually creating tests, quizzes, and assessments. This process was time-consuming, labor-intensive, and lacked personalization for individual learners. The need for a system that could alleviate this overhead and cater to the unique learning paths of students was clear.

  

## The Solution: A Seamless Integration of Systems

To address this, I led the development of an automatic test builder. This innovative tool bridged various systems - Learning Management System (LMS), Content Management System (CMS), Quiz modules, and the Learner App. It functioned by selecting questions based on a pre-defined template and the individual skill levels of students, creating a tailor-made assessment.

  

## Product Features: Personalization and Flexibility

1. **Personalized Homework:** After each class, the tool generated homework tailored to the topics covered, directly assigned to the students who attended the class.
    
2. **Monthly Tests:** It created monthly tests for batches, focusing on the topics taught during that month.
    
3. **Adaptable Assessment Modes:** The assessments could be set in either online or offline modes, offering flexibility in delivery and accessibility.
    

  

## Metrics and Results: A Leap in Operational Efficiency

The most significant achievement of this tool was the drastic reduction in operational manhours - a cut down of over 3000 hours per week. This efficiency not only freed up valuable time for educators but also ensured that assessments were more aligned with the individual learning trajectories of students, resulting in ~20 percent point improvement in attempt rates and ~7 percent point improvement in student outcome.
