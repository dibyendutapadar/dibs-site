✔ Traditional OTAs like MakeMyTrip and Booking limit users to fixed filters.  
This project offers an unrestricted AI search experience based on user intent.

**Key Features**
- **Personalized Search**: Users describe their travel needs naturally.  
  Example: “A secluded stay by a riverside within 200 km from Bangalore with Wi-Fi and parking.”  
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Agents parse intent and fetch tailored options.  
- **Detailed Itineraries**: Generated using specialized agents.  

💡 **How it Works**
- Intent Mapper Agent → extracts key details  
- Finder Agent → searches suitable options  
- Formatter Agent → refines presentation  
- Itinerary Agent → builds full itinerary  

**Technologies Used**: Ollama, CrewAI, Streamlit
