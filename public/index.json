[{"content":"The Evolution of Product Management: A Brief History A little Introduction Product management! The ever-evolving, always-changing job, that is crucial to the success of any product-based company. From its humble beginnings as a behind-the-scenes role to the tech industry\u0026rsquo;s poster child, product management has come a long way. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll try to take a deep dive into the evolution of product management.\nProduct management might look like a BS job but not an easy job. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot like herding cats, but instead of cats, you\u0026rsquo;re trying to coordinate a group of developers, designers, and stakeholders to create a product that people will love. So, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at how product management has evolved over the years.\ntimeline title Evolution of Product Management 1930s : Brand Management emerges at Procter \u0026 Gamble : Full lifecycle ownership mindset begins 1980s : Product role becomes formal in tech-driven companies : User experience slowly starts becoming a priority 1990s : Silicon Valley growth fuels structured PM roles : Customer-first philosophy embraced by innovators (e.g., Apple) Early 2000s : Marty Cagan popularizes modern product thinking : Focus on value creation, empowered product teams 2010s : Lean Startup \u0026 MVP culture (Eric Ries) : Data-driven experimentation and rapid iteration become norms Late 2010s : Product-led growth becomes dominant SaaS strategy : Cross-functional squads and discovery frameworks mature 2020s : Generative AI and automation disrupt PM workflows : PM shifts toward strategic, systems-thinking leadership The Early Days #ProductManagement has been around for a long time, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t always a formalized role. In the early days of product development, the focus was on engineering and manufacturing, with little thought given to the user experience. As technology advanced and products became more complex, it became clear that there needed to be someone who could oversee the entire process and ensure that the product met the needs of the users.\nEnter the product manager. ==In the 1930s, Procter \u0026amp; Gamble introduced the concept of brand management, which included overseeing the entire life cycle of a product, from development to marketing==. This concept was later expanded to include product management, which focused on the product itself rather than just the brand.\nThe Rise of Silicon Valley Fast forward a few decades, and product management was beginning to take on a more prominent role in the tech industry. In the 1980s and 1990s, Silicon Valley was booming, and product management became a key function in many tech companies.\nOne of the most famous product managers of this era is Steve Jobs, who famously said,\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology, not the other way around.\u0026rdquo;\nThis philosophy became the foundation of Apple\u0026rsquo;s product development process, which has been emulated by countless companies since.\nAnother key figure in the evolution of product management is Marty Cagan, who was the VP of Products at eBay in the early 2000s. Cagan is the author of \u0026ldquo;Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love,\u0026rdquo; which has become a bible for many product managers. In the book, Cagan emphasizes the ==importance of focusing on the customer== and creating products that solve real problems.\nThe Lean Startup Movement In recent years, there has been a shift in the way that products are developed. The lean startup movement, which was popularized by Eric Ries in his book \u0026ldquo;The Lean Startup,\u0026rdquo; emphasizes the importance of rapid experimentation and user feedback.\nOne of the key principles of the lean startup approach is the idea of the ==minimum viable product (MVP)==. Instead of spending months or even years developing a product, the lean startup approach involves creating a stripped-down version of the product and getting it into the hands of users as quickly as possible. This allows the product team to gather feedback and make improvements based on real-world usage.\nThe lean startup approach has been embraced by many successful companies, including Dropbox, Airbnb, and Uber.\nThe Future of Product Management (As on before Nov 2022) So, what does the future hold for product management? As technology continues to advance and products become even more complex, the need for skilled product managers will only increase.\nOne trend that we\u0026rsquo;re likely to see in the coming years is the blurring of the lines between product management and other roles, such as design and engineering. As Jeff Gothelf puts it,\n\u0026ldquo;Product management is becoming synonymous with good design and good business.\u0026rdquo;\nIn order to create successful products, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to have a cross-functional team that includes product managers, designers, engineers, and other stakeholders. This means that product managers will need to have a broad range of skills and be able to work collaboratively with others.\nAnother trend that we\u0026rsquo;re likely to see is the ==increased use of data and analytics in product development==. Product managers will need to be skilled at gathering and analyzing data, and using that data to make informed decisions about product development.\nAs David Cancel, CEO of Drift, puts it,\n\u0026ldquo;The product manager of the future will be more data-driven, more customer-focused, and more design-aware.\u0026rdquo;\nIn order to be successful in this role, product managers will need to be adaptable and willing to learn new skills as technology and the market continue to evolve.\nIn comes ChatGPT and other generative AI The impact of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools on the role of product management is not very clear-cut. Some experts believe that AI tools will disrupt product management in a big way, while others argue that it will only enhance the role of product managers.\nAs Mark Faggiano, CEO of TaxJar, puts it,\n\u0026ldquo;The rise of AI and machine learning will likely automate many of the tactical responsibilities of product management, but it will also open up new opportunities for strategic leadership.\u0026rdquo;\nIn other words, AI tools can handle the mundane tasks of product management, such as data analysis and reporting, allowing product managers to focus on higher-level strategic thinking and decision-making.\nOn the other hand, some experts believe that AI tools will eventually replace the need for human product managers altogether.\n\u0026ldquo;AI can predict what the customer wants and needs, what features will have the most impact, and even what the price point should be.\u0026rdquo;\n==If AI tools can do all of that, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of having a human product manager?==\nHowever, many product managers and industry leaders argue that AI tools cannot replace the human touch when it comes to product development. As Teresa Torres, product discovery coach and author, puts it,\n\u0026ldquo;Product management is still a human-centric role, focused on understanding people and solving their problems.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile AI tools can provide valuable insights, they cannot replace the empathy and creativity that human product managers bring to the table, at least not yet.\nSo, while the impact of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools on the role of product management is still up for debate, one thing is clear: product managers will need to continue to evolve and adapt to stay relevant in a rapidly changing technological landscape. As Eric Feng, former CTO of Hulu, puts it,\n\u0026ldquo;Product management will always be necessary, but the definition of the role will change over time.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd as we have seen throughout the brief history, this is, I guess, the fastest evolving role in the entire business world, The key for product managers will be to stay ahead of the curve and ==embrace new technologies as they emerge.==\nProduct management is an essential role and is unlikely to be eliminated any time soon. While the role may evolve with the emergence of new technologies, the need for human product managers who can bring empathy, creativity, and strategic thinking to the table will continue to be in demand. As the future of product management continues to take shape, one thing is for sure: this is an exciting and challenging role that will continue to be in high demand for years to come.\n\u0026ldquo;The role of the product manager is to discover a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd with the right skills and mindset, product managers can keep on doing just that.\n","permalink":"https://dibyendupm.com/art-of-pm/the-evolution-of-product-management/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-evolution-of-product-management-a-brief-history\"\u003eThe Evolution of Product Management: A Brief History\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-little-introduction\"\u003eA little Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct management!\u003c/strong\u003e The ever-evolving, always-changing job, that is crucial to the success of any product-based company.

Under the hood, it’s usually an unstructured mess—especially for small or mid-size fashion brands that haven’t fully automated their digital operations. The result is slow responses, lost orders, inconsistent inventory updates, and frustrated customers.\nThis project is a practical proof-of-concept that shows how LLMs can be deployed as real workers in this workflow. Not abstract magic. Actual operational logic.\nThe goal: Automatically read incoming emails, understand whether they are order requests or product inquiries, extract structured data, check stock, update inventory, and generate responses—end to end.\nEverything runs through a modular chain of LLM-based “micro-agents,” each responsible for a small, verifiable task. This keeps the system interpretable instead of becoming a mysterious black box.\nGithub Repo: Business Context: Why This Problem Exists A fashion retailer receives two types of recurring emails:\n“Do you have this in size M?”\n— product inquiries\n“I want to order 2 beige linen shirts.”\n— order requests\nThese land in a common inbox. Humans spend hours manually:\nreading each email\ndetermining intent\nchecking product catalog and stock\npreparing responses\nadjusting inventory\nlogging orders manually in sheets / db\nThe friction multiplies with scale.\nThe mistakes multiply even faster.\nAn LLM-based system solves exactly these bottlenecks:\nno missed orders\nreal-time stock updates\nconsistent responses\nstructured logs for auditing\nscalability without hiring more staff\nThe system is not meant to be a chatbot. It is meant to be an intelligent back-office worker—fast, predictable, and fully auditable.\nTechnical Overview: How the System Works The design intentionally avoids monolithic “one giant prompt” architectures. Instead, each function is a narrow expert—an independent agent.\nProcessing happens sequentially, not in batches, to maintain inventory correctness. When two emails request the same product, sequential order ensures one stock update happens before the next evaluation.\nEverything flows through a deterministic pipeline:\nflowchart TD A[llm_classify_email] --\u003e B[email-classification log] B --\u003e C{Is Order Request?} %% Order Request Path C --\u003e|Yes| D[llm_extract_order_items] D --\u003e E[process_order_requests_pipeline] E --\u003e F[llm_generate_order_response] F --\u003e G[order-response log] %% Product Inquiry Path C --\u003e|No, Product Inquiry| H[answer_inquiry_with_stock - RAG and stock lookup] H --\u003e I[inquiry-response log] %% Final Step G --\u003e J[Write all logs] I --\u003e J[Write all logs] This structure makes the system easy to reason about, easy to debug, and easy to extend.\nPotential Future Extensions Multi-store inventory sync If stock is distributed across warehouses. Price negotiation automation Common in boutique fashion retail. CRM integration Tag customers by intent, lifecycle, and purchase history. Predictive insights Incoming email patterns → demand forecasting (email-driven signals are underutilized gold) Full order booking Push confirmed orders directly into ERP or Shopify. The pipeline already supports extension because each agent is isolated.\n","permalink":"https://dibyendupm.com/projects/ai-powered-email-processing-system-for-a-fashion-retailer/","summary":"Turning chaotic inboxes into structured, automated order \u0026amp; inquiry workflows","title":"AI-Powered Email Processing System for a Fashion Retailer"},{"content":"The project enables chatting and extracting information and insights from internal documents using a locally deployed LLM.\nKey Features\nUses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain techniques Supports various document formats Provides accurate and context-aware responses based on document content 💡 Goal: Facilitate efficient and intelligent information retrieval from internal documents.\nTechnologies Used: LLM, RAG, LangChain, Streamlit, Ollama\n🔗 GitHub 📝 Read on LinkedIn ","permalink":"https://dibyendupm.com/projects/chat-with-local-documents/","summary":"Enables intelligent chat and data extraction from internal documents using a locally deployed LLM with RAG and LangChain.","title":"Chat with Local Documents"},{"content":"The word ‘Strategy’ in the business world has become almost synonymous with ‘Religion’ in general. Everyone claims they have one, everyone says their one is the right one, but very few understand what it is and a lot keep defining it in the most complex and contradictory ways.\nOne of our professors used to say,\nStrategy is the most used and least understood word in the business world.\nJust try to recall, how many times were you hurt to see this poor word, being beaten to death in those coveted meeting rooms.\nThere is a tendency of Product teams to enact themselves as the entire business (PMs love to call themselves mini CEOs 😛), and there\u0026rsquo;s no reason they would stay away from enacting this behavior as well, and that did happen. It didn’t take long before ==‘Product Strategy’ became a buzzword and just like in business, it stayed grossly overused and tremendously less understood.==\nWhat Strategy is not and what it is? In the overall Business sense, there is a tendency to confuse Operational excellence as Strategy. Operational effectiveness is not a strategy. The plan to reduce inefficiencies in your business is not a strategy.\nSimilarly, in a product sense, A Roadmap is not a Product Strategy. Having a sequence of tasks to deliver is not a strategy. More into that later, let us begin from the basics. What is Strategy?\nStrategy = A set of choices\nThat’s how Roger Martin defines it in the book, Playing to Win: How Strategy really works, and that’s it; it\u0026rsquo;s that simple. Strategies are choices to do something, to be something, etc. What we fail to comprehend is that every time we make a choice to do or be something, we are also making a decision NOT to be or do something. If we are NOT saying NO to a choice, it\u0026rsquo;s not a strategy, it\u0026rsquo;s just obvious.\nA very simple litmus test to check if we have a strategy is to ask ourselves, ==did we say NO to an alternative while choosing the other?== and why so?\n\u0026ldquo;The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.\u0026rdquo; — Michael E. Porter\nStrategy by examples It’s very difficult to comprehend such a widely overused word. So let’s put our bet on examples.\nIt’s not true that if you have a strategy, i.e, you have made certain choices, you will definitely succeed. More often than not, you will fail (That\u0026rsquo;s what the data says, About 90% of Businesses fail, and they all had a strategy)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at both sides. First, two success stories\nTesla: Conventional business logic is that when you\u0026rsquo;re starting something new, you create a \u0026lsquo;Minimal Viable Product\u0026rsquo; or MVP and sell it at a reasonably low starting price, or go freemium to get the initial growth. But Tesla decided not to do that and play the long-term game. Instead, Tesla created the most luxurious, expensive, fully-featured sports car they could afford. That car was the Tesla Roadster, and for context, the newest generation of the Roadster will retail from upwards of US$200,000 for the base model. This was the first car they ever produced - knowing that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t achieve the necessary scale or efficiency to turn a profit (even at such a high price). However, such a car was in-line with Tesla’s vision statement where they aim “to create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving the world’s transition to electric vehicles.” AirBnB: They Chose to improve the quality of every listing and said no to the volume of the listing. In a more basic sense, it opposes one of the most commonly stated principles of building a tech startup - “everything must be scalable”. The co-founders grabbed their cameras and visited every one of their NYC listings. They persuaded the owners to let them take a ton of photographs of their places. This is anything but scalable. Later, they did scale their initial solution by hiring young photographers in major locations and paying them to take professional photos of owners’ listings (at no charge to the owner). And in contrast to Tesla, Airbnb\u0026rsquo;s story shows that business strategies don’t have to be grand and super long-term affairs. Now two failure stories.\nKodak: It is well-known and well-quoted how Kodak invented the Digital camera, but decided not to launch it. This was their strategy, though a failed one. Kodak chose to NOT hurt the selling of single-use rolls of films by launching a Digital. Even when they were told that they had at most, 10 years until digital would completely displace film - they continued to resist in order to ensure that they met their own short term financial KPIs. It was a tough decision to take. Sabotaging own product takes courage, and they didn’t choose to do that Blackberry: Blackberry\u0026rsquo;s revenues were firmly entrenched in the B2B business model. They sold to corporations who then issued phones to their users. Blackberry\u0026rsquo;s entire pitch was geared towards corporations and they resisted user trends such as touch screens and mobile games because businesses didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to want these things. They chose to cater to the corporations and not the end users. That’s the choice they made, and that was their strategy. And when Apple came in, they were thrown out of the market. Circling back to where we started. If you think you have a strategy, just ask, did you say NO to an alternative or you are just doing everything that\u0026rsquo;s coming your way?\nProduct Roadmap is not Product Strategy The most common mistake that product managers often do is to confuse Product Strategy with a product roadmap, or a product plan. Strategy plays in the realm of the unknown, plans on the other hand, try to bring certainty and order to the chaos.\nConfusing the two, ‘strategy’ and ‘planning’ is a common mistake. A plan is quite simple. It is the detailed steps of how you are going to achieve something. Your roadmap is a form of plan. Your sprint plan, the way you intend to perform a release, etc are all plans.\nAs Mike Tyson famously said, “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth”…\nThink about strategy as how you’re going to deal with being punched in the mouth — are you going to punch back, kick, protect yourself, run away? What are the set of key choices that will guide future decisions? Are you a fighter or no? Do you want to be known as one or no?\nWho makes the Strategy? There is no magical line in the org where strategy begins. The “decision-makers” and “executors” dichotomy is a fallacy. Strategy is more of a spectrum. Everyone in the organization makes a set of choices, just at varying levels. The problem is, we treat bigger choices as strategies and smaller choices as not.\nFor example, making a decision on whether the company should acquire another company - that’s a pretty big choice. As opposed to making a decision to write a line of code a certain way or to put a button in a specific spot on the screen. These are still choices. Just strategies on a smaller scale with a smaller impact.\nSo the notion, that as you become senior you become more strategic, is not entirely true. Rather as a senior, you are now responsible to make bigger decisions, with bigger impact and hence tougher choices. You’re just operating at a different scale — like going from playing the guitar at home alone to playing at a professional level in front of a live audience as part of the symphony orchestra.\nHow to Build your Product Strategy: There are a lot of frameworks lying around the internet, the Amazon 6 pager, the Lean Canvas, Netflix DHM model. It’s very tempting to pick up a framework to build a strategy, but just like the same strategy doesn’t work for all, the same framework won’t work for all.\n(Personal Opinion) It’s always better to craft your own strategy framework, because your case is different from all other business cases. If it had already been done by someone else, why would you even do it?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to decode and conquer the 4 basic steps of making a strategy.\nWhat do you want to achieve? What’s stopping you from achieving them? What are your choices? Which choice are you going to make? Step 1: What do you want to achieve? - The Vision Before jumping to the strategy you need a Product Vision. This is often guided by the business vision. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume that the business has already made a choice to be something and NOT to be something, and a desired state for the Product is defined. Thereafter, it comes down to the Product to have their strategy around it.\nExamples of product vision:\nIn 10 years, Uber will be, the cheaper alternative to owning a car or to taking public transport\nIn 5 years Google Workspace will be the default choice to create, communicate, and collaborate where work is more flexible, time is more precious, and enabling stronger human\nIn 4 years, Amazon will be a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s often beneficial to attach some metric to the product vision, which makes it easier to define the problem space. That being said, there might be cases when you are too far away from defining metric, in those cases, forcefully superimposing a metric just for the sake of it is not recommended.\nStep 2: What’s stopping us from achieving the Vision- The Problem Space. Once you have the vision in place, the next part is to examine what major challenges are there in the way to achieving them. The challenge can be anything and in any space, for Uber, it can be the waiting time, the cost, and the availability of cars/drivers. For Google Workspace, it can be their competitor (Microsoft). For Amazon, it can be traffic, listing spread and quality, and availability of sellers.\nThe Problem spaces can be multifold. You do not need to focus on just one here. You can, and most probably you will, have to prioritize; which one will you be solving first. That being said but you do need to know and be mindful of the entire problem space.\nStep 3: What are my choices? Making choices are difficult. So we should start from the basics. Just like you need to know all your problem statements, you need to know all the alternative choices that may help to solve the problem spaces. And then you make a set of choices from them.\nHow to list down the choices? A basic set of exploration in all your control areas can help you get the list of choices.\nDisclaimer: This can be either relevant or irrelevant for individual cases, these are just examples and not a framework.\nState of the product: At what stage the product is currently at? Can I continue like this to achieve the vision or do I need a revamp? If I need a revamp, do I need to do it now, or can I delay it, and by how much? What the data says: What are my metrics? Are my metrics aligned with my vision? If not, what do I need to change? Are the current data points directing that we can achieve the vision? Which data points should I focus on and which data points should I not? Which features will help me set the data right and which feature should will not? What the customers say: Do the customer feedbacks resonate with my vision? Am I providing the Product which will make customers spell out the Vision by themselves? If not which feature should I build and which feature should I NOT build? What the Stakeholders want: Do the features resonate with both stakeholders and the vision? If not, which should I discontinue and which should I choose to prioritize? What the competitors are doing: Is my strategy the same as my competitors? If my vision is different from my competitor, then how can I have the same strategy in the same market? What should I NOT do that is currently aligning with my competitors\u0026rsquo; vision and not my vision? Step 4: Making the choice This is the most difficult part. Unlike what most people claim, there’s no right or wrong, there’s no framework or formula for success. If there would have been, then all business would have succeeded. Business history is full of examples where a similar strategy has been a success for one org and a disaster for another. It’s completely up to the concerned people’s acumens, experiences, biases, passions, business and logical senses, knowledge etc, to take the decision.\n\u0026ldquo;The real challenge in crafting strategy, lies in detecting subtle discontinuities that may undermine a business in the future. And for that there is no technique, no program, just a sharp mind in touch with the situation.\u0026rdquo; — Henry Mintzberg\nIt’s important to have a strategy, that is to ==have a set of choices, chosen from a list of alternatives.== Having a strategy doesn’t guarantee success, but not having a strategy almost always guarantees failure, and sometimes it’s delayed. A delayed failure is worse than a quick failure. In case of a quick failure, we will still have the chance to change the strategy.\nHowever, making a strategy takes a tremendous amount of courage; ==Courage to say NO, Courage to be held accountable for the outcome, and that’s not easy==. The best Product Leaders are the ones who made choices.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at an example, A strategy that Sundar Pichai (In my opinion one of the greatest Product Leaders) undertook took when he started at Google.\nSundar Pichai and the story of Chrome Pichai started at Google, leading product management for the Google toolbar, a critically strategic product (as per the management at that time) that enabled default search queries on different web browsers to go through Google and allow them to track browsing behavior to power the AdWords targeting engine. At the time, Internet Explorer was the “installed by default” incumbent for many users, while Firefox was the alternative browser of choice.\nIn 2006, Pichai recognized that having to add a toolbar to your browser to perform a basic function like ‘search’ might NOT be the best strategy. The first time Pichai pitched the idea for Chrome, it was shot down for being \u0026rsquo;too expensive\u0026rsquo;. It was only after Pichai compiled data and bid his case to the stakeholders, that the project was greenlit. Now, Chrome is the most popular search engine across platforms and devices (not safe and secure, but the most popular)\nPichai identified a weakness in Google’s strategy, and Chrome began as a defensive play against the established browsers to protect and grow Google’s search business (which still generates much of the company’s revenue). There was no guarantee other browsers would continue making it easy for toolbars like Google’s to be installed by users, particularly Microsoft, who was still hoping they could establish their own inroads in the search market with Bing.\nChrome wasn’t just another alternative web browser, it was a foothold on the desktop extending Google’s reach into the consumer web experience. Google was no longer just the homepage when you launched your browser or the results that came up when you entered a search query; it was now an end-to-end browsing experience.\nNow that is a Product Strategy, that quarterly/half-yearly roadmap on a slide deck is not.

LLaMA is one of your go-to LLM for processing text, while LLaVA is a novel end-to-end trained large multimodal model that combines a vision encoder and Vicuna for general-purpose visual and language understanding.\nTogether, they’re the dynamic duo that enables this app to seamlessly juggle both text and images.\nI have used 8b models of both, but if you have access to superior computing power (read GPU) you can use larger models as well\nAI Agents and Crew AI Here’s where it gets even cooler—AI agents. These are autonomous helpers that handle tasks for you. In our app, we use CrewAI to coordinate these agents, making sure everything runs smoothly. It’s like having a team of experts working behind the scenes to ensure your photos and captions are on point.\nHow It All Comes Together So, how exactly we select from photos into Instagram-worthy posts? Let’s break it down:\nUpload Your Photos: Start by uploading your images—whether they’re in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format. AI Image Analysis: The magic begins as LLAVA gets to work, analyzing your images to extract detailed descriptions. It’s like having an art critic and a storyteller rolled into one, interpreting each photo. Crafting the Perfect Caption: Armed with these descriptions the agent then picks the best image and writes a caption that’s primed for maximum engagement. It considers everything from trending hashtags to current events. AI Agent in Action: Crew AI coordinates the process, ensuring that the agent’s decisions are spot on. The agent doesn’t just pick a photo and write a caption; it does so with a clear strategy in mind, maximizing your post’s potential to go viral. Your Ready-Made Instagram Post: Finally, the app presents the results in a clean, easy-to-use format. You get a detailed breakdown of all your photos, the chosen winner with an explanation, and a caption ready to be copied and pasted straight into Instagram. And the best part about this,\nAll this is achieved without any need to train the model on own data.\nGone are the days of scrambling to gather massive datasets just to get started. These pre-trained models give you a serious head start. Sure, you can fine-tune them with your specific data to make them even better, but as you can see from the results, they’re already delivering impressive outcomes right out of the box.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the big deal? ChatGPT can already do this. Of course, it can—but there’s a catch. While GPT-4 and its image processing capabilities can handle similar tasks, these features often come with a price tag.\nPlus, our app is a playground for these ideas, offering a fun, user-friendly way to explore what AI can do with your images. Now, imagine scaling this up for industrial use cases. Organizations can employ similar methodologies to tackle specific challenges unique to their operations—without the worry of sharing sensitive information with a third-party service like ChatGPT.\nIn-house AI solutions provide a tailored approach, ensuring privacy and control over proprietary data.\nBeyond a toy app to Organizational use cases Below are some industry use cases where images are too sensitive and confidential to be exposed to third part service provider. Getting LLMs deployed on premise, can help maintian the secrecy and getting the job done.\nHealthTech Medical Imaging: Assist in diagnosing conditions from X-rays to MRIs. Lets see this in action. It was fascinating to see how much can be achieved without any fine tuning from a 8b vision model and a 8b text model with 30 lines of code on a personal laptop\nEdTech Grading Exams: Automate grading for handwritten exams, ensuring fairness and speed. (I have a hunch that with the democratisation of GenAI, handwritten exams are going to come back. For EdTech enthusiasts, you can read this study on the effect of GenAI on education) Let\u0026rsquo;s see how an untuned model can provide a head start for evaluation of answer scripts.\nIt can also be used in other sectors where information is absolutely confidential\nFinTech Customer Verification: Automate document verification with image analysis. Insurance Claims Processing: Quickly assess damages with image evaluation.

Navigate to the Forecast page to get started.\nHolt-Winters Triple Exponential Smoothing Holt-Winters Triple Exponential Smoothing, also known as Holt-Winters Method, is used for forecasting time series data that exhibits both trend and seasonality. The model requires you to set values for trend, seasonal, and seasonal_periods. Here’s a guide on how to determine these values:\nUnderstanding the Parameters: Trend (trend): This parameter indicates whether a trend component is included in the model. It can be: 'add' (additive): When the trend is expected to increase or decrease by a constant amount. 'mul' (multiplicative): When the trend increases or decreases by a percentage or ratio. None: When there is no trend. Seasonal (seasonal): This parameter indicates whether a seasonal component is included in the model. It can be: 'add' (additive): When seasonal variations are roughly constant over time. 'mul' (multiplicative): When seasonal variations change proportionally to the level of the time series. None: When there is no seasonality. Seasonal Periods (seasonal_periods): This parameter indicates the length of the seasonality cycle (e.g., 12 for monthly data with annual seasonality). Selecting the Parameters: a. Identify Trend and Seasonality: Visual Inspection: Plot your time series data. Look for patterns in the data: A consistent upward or downward slope suggests a trend. Repeating patterns at regular intervals suggest seasonality. Statistical Tests: Use autocorrelation plots (ACF) and partial autocorrelation plots (PACF) to identify seasonality. Significant spikes at lags corresponding to the seasonal period can indicate seasonality. b. Determine Seasonal Periods: Domain Knowledge: Use domain knowledge to identify the seasonal cycle. For instance, monthly data often has an annual seasonality period of 12 months. Autocorrelation: Significant autocorrelations at specific lags can help identify the seasonal period. c. Choosing Trend and Seasonal Types: Additive vs. Multiplicative: Use additive ('add') if the seasonal variations are roughly constant over time (the difference between high and low seasonality periods is constant). Use multiplicative ('mul') if the seasonal variations change proportionally with the level of the series (the percentage change is constant). SARIMAX Model SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) is an extension of the ARIMA model that supports both seasonality and exogenous variables. It is used for forecasting time series data. The model parameters need to be carefully chosen to fit the data well. Here’s a guide on understanding and selecting these parameters:\nUnderstanding the Parameters: Non-Seasonal Components: p: The number of lag observations included in the model (autoregressive part). d: The number of times that the raw observations are differenced (integrated part). q: The size of the moving average window. Seasonal Components: P: The number of lag observations in the seasonal model (seasonal autoregressive part). D: The number of times that the seasonal differences are applied (seasonal integrated part). Q: The size of the moving average window in the seasonal model. m: The number of time steps for a single seasonal period. Exogenous Variables (X): These are additional variables that can be included in the model to provide more information that might affect the time series. Selecting the Parameters: a. Identify Non-Seasonal Parameters (p, d, q):\nVisual Inspection: Plot your time series data to look for trends and seasonality. ACF and PACF Plots: ACF (Autocorrelation Function): Helps in identifying the number of MA (q) terms. Significant spikes outside the confidence interval suggest the lag values. PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function): Helps in identifying the number of AR (p) terms. Significant spikes outside the confidence interval suggest the lag values. Differencing: If the time series is non-stationary, apply differencing and observe the ACF and PACF plots again. Differencing helps to stabilize the mean of the time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, thereby eliminating (or reducing) trend and seasonality. b. Identify Seasonal Parameters (P, D, Q, m):\nSeasonal Differencing: If seasonality is present, seasonal differencing may be necessary. Seasonal ACF and PACF: Look at the ACF and PACF plots of the seasonally differenced series to identify seasonal AR (P) and MA (Q) terms. The seasonal period (m) should be known from the data (e.g., m = 12 for monthly data with yearly seasonality). c. Combining the Parameters:\nUse the identified non-seasonal and seasonal parameters to build the SARIMAX model. Exogenous Variables: Include any relevant external variables (X) if they are believed to influence the time series.

This ensures that the data is easily accessible and manageable. Passing Context to the LLM: This JSON data is passed as context to the LLM model (\u0026ldquo;llama-3.1-8b-instant\u0026rdquo;) via the Groq API, enabling the chatbot to respond with accurate and relevant information. Maintaining Chat Sessions: Consecutive chats in the session are also passed to the Groq API, ensuring that the bot remembers the flow of the conversation and maintains context throughout the interaction. Streamlit as the FrontEnd: used streamlit to provide a forntend to the interaction happening in the chat 👉 Check out the code in GitHub Where can it lead to? Dynamic Data Integration: While I used static information, the system can easily be adapted to pull live data from various sources, keeping the chatbot updated with current prices and availability. WhatsApp, Call? why not: Although I hosted the application on Streamlit, we can scale it, manage webhooks with ngrok , integrate it with platforms like Twilio to manage WhatsApp/SMS/Call interactions, or use text-to-speech AIs like vapi.ai for real-time conversations. Automated Booking Management: The chatbot can update booking information in a database, send confirmation emails to users, and remember past contexts from sessions to handle any follow-up queries seamlessly. Potential Use Cases: The applications of this technology extend far beyond the hospitality industry. Here are a few exciting possibilities:\nHealthcare: Streamlining patient appointments and managing inquiries. Retail: Assisting customers with product searches and order placements. Finance: Providing customer support for banking services and loan applications. Education: Facilitating enrollment processes and answering student queries. The Advantages of LLM based chat bots: The chatbot will respond naturally, so users won\u0026rsquo;t feel like they\u0026rsquo;re talking to a bot or navigating an IVR system. The user won\u0026rsquo;t be prompted to select one from the below options. The LLM can adapt to the conversation and provide personalized responses each time, enhancing the user experience. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to have huge set of data/ sample interactions to train the chatbots. Though they certainly be beneficial, but we can start fast, reducing the time to market. The bot can be provided with basic context and data, and it would perform quite well. This wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been possible without this open sourced LLMs. Technologies Used: LLM, Groq API, Streamlit\n🔗 GitHub 📝 Article 📱 App Link ","permalink":"https://dibyendupm.com/projects/llm-driven-hotel-booking-chatbot/","summary":"Real-time conversational booking assistant powered by Groq API and Streamlit.","title":"LLM-Driven Hotel Booking Chatbot"},{"content":"Introduction In the bustling urban landscape, efficient traffic management is crucial for the smooth functioning of cities. Traffic signal control plays a pivotal role in regulating the flow of vehicles at intersections, ensuring safety, and minimizing congestion. To address the complexities of traffic signal coordination, I introduce a web application that empowers traffic engineers and city planners to optimize signal durations based on real-time traffic flow data.\nProblem Statement Traditional traffic signal systems often operate on fixed schedules, neglecting the dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This rigidity can lead to unnecessary delays, increased fuel consumption, and heightened environmental impact. Furthermore, the lack of tools to easily customize signal durations for specific intersections and traffic conditions poses a challenge for traffic management authorities.\nSolution This web application provides a comprehensive solution to the aforementioned challenges, offering a user-friendly interface and advanced functionalities. The system allows users to define and customize traffic signal timings at a granular level, considering the number of directions, specific coordinates for each direction, and real-time traffic flow data. (This is a personal project)\nProduct Features 1. Interactive Map Selection Users can select the location of a traffic signal crossing with the help of an interactive Bing Map interface. 2. Direction Input The application guides users through the process of inputting the number of directions traffic flows across the crossing.\nEach direction is uniquely identified, allowing for precise customization.\n3. Coordinate Mapping For each direction, users can easily input \u0026ldquo;from\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; coordinates by selecting points on the map.\nThis feature streamlines the process of defining the geographic scope of each traffic flow.\n4. Cycle Time Configuration Users can set the total cycle time for the traffic signal, offering flexibility in adjusting the overall timing based on specific requirements.\nThe default cycle time is calculated as \u0026rsquo;number of directions\u0026rsquo; times 90 seconds, providing a starting point for customization.\n5. Dynamic Traffic Flow Calculation The system integrates with bing API to fetch real-time traffic flow data between specified coordinates.\nThis data is used to dynamically calculate signal durations for each direction.\n6. Result Display The application presents the calculated signal durations in a clear and concise tabular format.\nUsers can easily interpret and implement the recommended signal timings for optimized traffic management.\nConclusion This Traffic Signal Control web application serves as a foundational step towards transforming traffic management in urban environments. While the current system empowers users to optimize signal durations at a specific intersection, its potential for scalability is a key aspect that can revolutionize citywide traffic flow.\nExtending the System to Configure Citywide Traffic Lights As cities evolve, the need for comprehensive traffic management systems becomes paramount. The simplicity and effectiveness of our web application pave the way for scaling the system to configure all traffic lights within a city. By expanding the tool\u0026rsquo;s capabilities to encompass multiple intersections, city planners and traffic engineers can holistically address traffic challenges on a macro level.\nAutomated Updates for Enhanced Efficiency Furthermore, envisioning a future where this system integrates with real-time traffic data and machine learning algorithms allows for automated updates. By leveraging data-driven insights, the system can continuously learn and adapt, reducing the reliance on manual interventions. This not only optimizes traffic flow but also enhances the overall efficiency of the transportation infrastructure.\nAdvantages of Reduced Human Intervention The automation of traffic signal configurations for an entire city comes with several advantages. It minimizes the risk of human error, ensures consistency in traffic management strategies, and allows for quicker responses to changing traffic patterns. Reduced human intervention translates to improved reliability and responsiveness, ultimately resulting in smoother traffic flow and reduced congestion.\n📱 App Link ","permalink":"https://dibyendupm.com/projects/automated-traffic-signal-duration-simulator/","summary":"Simulates optimal signal durations using real-time Bing Maps traffic data.","title":"Automated Traffic Signal Duration Simulator"},{"content":"This application simulates the planning of delivery routes for a specified number of locations and delivery agents within Bangalore.
