[{"content":"AI-Powered Email Processing System for a Fashion Retailer Turning chaotic inboxes into structured, automated order \u0026amp; inquiry workflows Retail operations look deceptively simple from the outside: customers email, staff respond, orders get booked, stock gets updated. Under the hood, it’s usually an unstructured mess—especially for small or mid-size fashion brands that haven’t fully automated their digital operations. The result is slow responses, lost orders, inconsistent inventory updates, and frustrated customers.\nThis project is a practical proof-of-concept that shows how LLMs can be deployed as real workers in this workflow. Not abstract magic. Actual operational logic.\nThe goal: Automatically read incoming emails, understand whether they are order requests or product inquiries, extract structured data, check stock, update inventory, and generate responses—end to end.\nEverything runs through a modular chain of LLM-based “micro-agents,” each responsible for a small, verifiable task. This keeps the system interpretable instead of becoming a mysterious black box.\nRepo:\nBusiness Context: Why This Problem Exists A fashion retailer receives two types of recurring emails:\n“Do you have this in size M?”\n— product inquiries\n“I want to order 2 beige linen shirts.”\n— order requests\nThese land in a common inbox. Humans spend hours manually:\nreading each email\ndetermining intent\nchecking product catalog and stock\npreparing responses\nadjusting inventory\nlogging orders manually in sheets / db\nThe friction multiplies with scale.\nThe mistakes multiply even faster.\nAn LLM-based system solves exactly these bottlenecks:\nno missed orders\nreal-time stock updates\nconsistent responses\nstructured logs for auditing\nscalability without hiring more staff\nThe system is not meant to be a chatbot. It is meant to be an intelligent back-office worker—fast, predictable, and fully auditable.\nTechnical Overview: How the System Works The design intentionally avoids monolithic “one giant prompt” architectures. Instead, each function is a narrow expert—an independent agent.\nProcessing happens sequentially, not in batches, to maintain inventory correctness. When two emails request the same product, sequential order ensures one stock update happens before the next evaluation.\nEverything flows through a deterministic pipeline:\nflowchart TD A[llm_classify_email] --\u003e B[email-classification log] B --\u003e C{Is Order Request?} %% Order Request Path C --\u003e|Yes| D[llm_extract_order_items] D --\u003e E[process_order_requests_pipeline] E --\u003e F[llm_generate_order_response] F --\u003e G[order-response log] %% Product Inquiry Path C --\u003e|No, Product Inquiry| H[answer_inquiry_with_stock - RAG and stock lookup] H --\u003e I[inquiry-response log] %% Final Step G --\u003e J[Write all logs] I --\u003e J[Write all logs] This structure makes the system easy to reason about, easy to debug, and easy to extend.\nPotential Future Extensions Multi-store inventory sync If stock is distributed across warehouses. Price negotiation automation Common in boutique fashion retail. CRM integration Tag customers by intent, lifecycle, and purchase history. Predictive insights Incoming email patterns → demand forecasting (email-driven signals are underutilized gold) Full order booking Push confirmed orders directly into ERP or Shopify. The pipeline already supports extension because each agent is isolated.\n","permalink":"https://dibyendupm.netlify.app/projects/ai-powered-email-processing-system-for-a-fashion-retailer/","summary":"Turning chaotic inboxes into structured, automated order \u0026amp; inquiry workflows","title":"AI-Powered Email Processing System for a Fashion Retailer"},{"content":"The project enables chatting and extracting information and insights from internal documents using a locally deployed LLM.\nKey Features\nUses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain techniques Supports various document formats Provides accurate and context-aware responses based on document content 💡 Goal: Facilitate efficient and intelligent information retrieval from internal documents.\nTechnologies Used: LLM, RAG, LangChain, Streamlit, Ollama\n🔗 GitHub 📝 Read on LinkedIn ","permalink":"https://dibyendupm.netlify.app/projects/chat-with-local-documents/","summary":"Enables intelligent chat and data extraction from internal documents using a locally deployed LLM with RAG and LangChain.","title":"Chat with Local Documents"},{"content":"AI Travel Agent with crewAI and Ollama Traditional OTAs like MakeMyTrip and Booking limit users to fixed filters.\nThis project offers an unrestricted AI search experience based on user intent.

How about a crew of AI agents who can sift through your snaps, pick the absolute best ones, and even whip up the perfect Instagram captions? Say goodbye to the endless selection and caption conundrums. With AI agents, we are stepping into the future of AI-powered creativity, where your snaps are transformed into Instagram hits without breaking a sweat.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Insta Influencer\u0026rdquo; Image Analyzer This nifty app is like having your very own Instagram manager on speed dial. Simply upload a bunch of images, and let the AI do the heavy lifting. It doesn’t just pick the best photo; it goes a step further by crafting a caption that’s not only on-trend but tailored to the vibe of your image. How? By harnessing the power of advanced AI models that understands images and what makes a post pop on Instagram.\n🔗 Check out the Git repo here: https://github.com/dibyendutapadar/ai-agent-image-analyzer Demo: I provided the app some pics from Goa trip to analyze from. The response was quite astonishing form 8b models run on local. Notice how detailed the image descriptions are.\nThe Tech That Makes It All Happen Large Language Models (LLMs) At the heart of this magic is obviously LLMs (Large Language Models). LLMs have been game-changers in making our interactions with technology more natural, almost like chatting with a super-smart friend.\nLLaMA and LLAVA Now, let’s talk about two key players: LLaMA (Large Language Model Accelerated) and LLAVA (Large Language Vision Agent). LLaMA is one of your go-to LLM for processing text, while LLaVA is a novel end-to-end trained large multimodal model that combines a vision encoder and Vicuna for general-purpose visual and language understanding.\nTogether, they’re the dynamic duo that enables this app to seamlessly juggle both text and images.\nI have used 8b models of both, but if you have access to superior computing power (read GPU) you can use larger models as well\nAI Agents and Crew AI Here’s where it gets even cooler—AI agents. These are autonomous helpers that handle tasks for you. In our app, we use CrewAI to coordinate these agents, making sure everything runs smoothly. It’s like having a team of experts working behind the scenes to ensure your photos and captions are on point.\nHow It All Comes Together So, how exactly we select from photos into Instagram-worthy posts? Let’s break it down:\nUpload Your Photos: Start by uploading your images—whether they’re in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format. AI Image Analysis: The magic begins as LLAVA gets to work, analyzing your images to extract detailed descriptions. It’s like having an art critic and a storyteller rolled into one, interpreting each photo. Crafting the Perfect Caption: Armed with these descriptions the agent then picks the best image and writes a caption that’s primed for maximum engagement. It considers everything from trending hashtags to current events. AI Agent in Action: Crew AI coordinates the process, ensuring that the agent’s decisions are spot on. The agent doesn’t just pick a photo and write a caption; it does so with a clear strategy in mind, maximizing your post’s potential to go viral. Your Ready-Made Instagram Post: Finally, the app presents the results in a clean, easy-to-use format. You get a detailed breakdown of all your photos, the chosen winner with an explanation, and a caption ready to be copied and pasted straight into Instagram. And the best part about this,\nAll this is achieved without any need to train the model on own data.\nGone are the days of scrambling to gather massive datasets just to get started. These pre-trained models give you a serious head start. Sure, you can fine-tune them with your specific data to make them even better, but as you can see from the results, they’re already delivering impressive outcomes right out of the box.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the big deal? ChatGPT can already do this. Of course, it can—but there’s a catch. While GPT-4 and its image processing capabilities can handle similar tasks, these features often come with a price tag.\nPlus, our app is a playground for these ideas, offering a fun, user-friendly way to explore what AI can do with your images. Now, imagine scaling this up for industrial use cases. Organizations can employ similar methodologies to tackle specific challenges unique to their operations—without the worry of sharing sensitive information with a third-party service like ChatGPT.\nIn-house AI solutions provide a tailored approach, ensuring privacy and control over proprietary data.\nBeyond a toy app to Organizational use cases Below are some industry use cases where images are too sensitive and confidential to be exposed to third part service provider. Getting LLMs deployed on premise, can help maintian the secrecy and getting the job done.\nHealthTech Medical Imaging: Assist in diagnosing conditions from X-rays to MRIs. Lets see this in action. It was fascinating to see how much can be achieved without any fine tuning from a 8b vision model and a 8b text model with 30 lines of code on a personal laptop\nEdTech Grading Exams: Automate grading for handwritten exams, ensuring fairness and speed. (I have a hunch that with the democratisation of GenAI, handwritten exams are going to come back. For EdTech enthusiasts, you can read this study on the effect of GenAI on education) Let\u0026rsquo;s see how an untuned model can provide a head start for evaluation of answer scripts.\nIt can also be used in other sectors where information is absolutely confidential\nFinTech Customer Verification: Automate document verification with image analysis.

Navigate to the Forecast page to get started.\nHolt-Winters Triple Exponential Smoothing Holt-Winters Triple Exponential Smoothing, also known as Holt-Winters Method, is used for forecasting time series data that exhibits both trend and seasonality. The model requires you to set values for trend, seasonal, and seasonal_periods. Here’s a guide on how to determine these values:\nUnderstanding the Parameters: Trend (trend): This parameter indicates whether a trend component is included in the model. It can be: 'add' (additive): When the trend is expected to increase or decrease by a constant amount. 'mul' (multiplicative): When the trend increases or decreases by a percentage or ratio. None: When there is no trend. Seasonal (seasonal): This parameter indicates whether a seasonal component is included in the model. It can be: 'add' (additive): When seasonal variations are roughly constant over time. 'mul' (multiplicative): When seasonal variations change proportionally to the level of the time series. None: When there is no seasonality. Seasonal Periods (seasonal_periods): This parameter indicates the length of the seasonality cycle (e.g., 12 for monthly data with annual seasonality). Selecting the Parameters: a. Identify Trend and Seasonality: Visual Inspection: Plot your time series data. Look for patterns in the data: A consistent upward or downward slope suggests a trend. Repeating patterns at regular intervals suggest seasonality. Statistical Tests: Use autocorrelation plots (ACF) and partial autocorrelation plots (PACF) to identify seasonality. Significant spikes at lags corresponding to the seasonal period can indicate seasonality. b. Determine Seasonal Periods: Domain Knowledge: Use domain knowledge to identify the seasonal cycle. For instance, monthly data often has an annual seasonality period of 12 months. Autocorrelation: Significant autocorrelations at specific lags can help identify the seasonal period. c. Choosing Trend and Seasonal Types: Additive vs. Multiplicative: Use additive ('add') if the seasonal variations are roughly constant over time (the difference between high and low seasonality periods is constant). Use multiplicative ('mul') if the seasonal variations change proportionally with the level of the series (the percentage change is constant). SARIMAX Model SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) is an extension of the ARIMA model that supports both seasonality and exogenous variables. It is used for forecasting time series data. The model parameters need to be carefully chosen to fit the data well. Here’s a guide on understanding and selecting these parameters:\nUnderstanding the Parameters: Non-Seasonal Components: p: The number of lag observations included in the model (autoregressive part). d: The number of times that the raw observations are differenced (integrated part). q: The size of the moving average window. Seasonal Components: P: The number of lag observations in the seasonal model (seasonal autoregressive part). D: The number of times that the seasonal differences are applied (seasonal integrated part). Q: The size of the moving average window in the seasonal model. m: The number of time steps for a single seasonal period. Exogenous Variables (X): These are additional variables that can be included in the model to provide more information that might affect the time series. Selecting the Parameters: a. Identify Non-Seasonal Parameters (p, d, q):\nVisual Inspection: Plot your time series data to look for trends and seasonality. ACF and PACF Plots: ACF (Autocorrelation Function): Helps in identifying the number of MA (q) terms. Significant spikes outside the confidence interval suggest the lag values. PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function): Helps in identifying the number of AR (p) terms. Significant spikes outside the confidence interval suggest the lag values. Differencing: If the time series is non-stationary, apply differencing and observe the ACF and PACF plots again. Differencing helps to stabilize the mean of the time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, thereby eliminating (or reducing) trend and seasonality. b. Identify Seasonal Parameters (P, D, Q, m):\nSeasonal Differencing: If seasonality is present, seasonal differencing may be necessary. Seasonal ACF and PACF: Look at the ACF and PACF plots of the seasonally differenced series to identify seasonal AR (P) and MA (Q) terms. The seasonal period (m) should be known from the data (e.g., m = 12 for monthly data with yearly seasonality). c. Combining the Parameters:\nUse the identified non-seasonal and seasonal parameters to build the SARIMAX model. Exogenous Variables: Include any relevant external variables (X) if they are believed to influence the time series.

TL;DR Harnessing the power of open-source LLMs like Llama 3.1, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to create a chatbot that simplifies hotel bookings, using \u0026ldquo;llama-3.1-8b-instant\u0026rdquo; model, Groq for enhanced AI performance and Streamlit for a seamless web interface. The chatbot can answer user queries, remember chat contexts, take and manage bookings.\n🎥 Watch the demo video 🔗 Check out the application on Streamlit Cloud Background In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, the advent of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like DCLM and Llama 3.1 has been looked at as a game-changer. But without real-world application, a good technology is like a work of art, valuable but not tangible.\nFor the past few days, I\u0026rsquo;ve been contemplating how we can harness these powerful tools. Coincidentally, while planning a weekend getaway, I found myself booking a hotel room through a WhatsApp conversation with a human receptionist. This got me thinking: can we use an LLM to handle bookings just as effectively? It seemed like a long shot, but I decided to give it a try.\nDiscovering the Tools: Groq and Streamlit During my research, I came across Groq and Streamlit:\nGroq: Imagine a super-efficient engine designed to accelerate machine learning models. Groq\u0026rsquo;s hardware and software solutions enhance the performance of AI applications, making them faster and more reliable. [ https://groq.com/ ] Streamlit: Think of Streamlit as a magic wand that turns your data scripts into shareable web apps. It\u0026rsquo;s a framework that allows you to create interactive websites from simple Python scripts, making data insights accessible and engaging. And streamlit-cloud makes the hosting a breeze. [ https://streamlit.io/ ] Building the Chatbot With these tools in hand and a little help from ChatGPT, I embarked on creating a chatbot to assist users with hotel bookings.\nThe Flow of the Code:\nHotel Information in JSON: The hotel details, including room types, prices, availability, and amenities, are structured in a JSON format. This ensures that the data is easily accessible and manageable. Passing Context to the LLM: This JSON data is passed as context to the LLM model (\u0026ldquo;llama-3.1-8b-instant\u0026rdquo;) via the Groq API, enabling the chatbot to respond with accurate and relevant information. Maintaining Chat Sessions: Consecutive chats in the session are also passed to the Groq API, ensuring that the bot remembers the flow of the conversation and maintains context throughout the interaction. Streamlit as the FrontEnd: used streamlit to provide a forntend to the interaction happening in the chat 👉 Check out the code in GitHub Where can it lead to? Dynamic Data Integration: While I used static information, the system can easily be adapted to pull live data from various sources, keeping the chatbot updated with current prices and availability. WhatsApp, Call? why not: Although I hosted the application on Streamlit, we can scale it, manage webhooks with ngrok , integrate it with platforms like Twilio to manage WhatsApp/SMS/Call interactions, or use text-to-speech AIs like vapi.ai for real-time conversations. Automated Booking Management: The chatbot can update booking information in a database, send confirmation emails to users, and remember past contexts from sessions to handle any follow-up queries seamlessly. Potential Use Cases: The applications of this technology extend far beyond the hospitality industry. Here are a few exciting possibilities:\nHealthcare: Streamlining patient appointments and managing inquiries. Retail: Assisting customers with product searches and order placements. Finance: Providing customer support for banking services and loan applications. Education: Facilitating enrollment processes and answering student queries. The Advantages of LLM based chat bots: The chatbot will respond naturally, so users won\u0026rsquo;t feel like they\u0026rsquo;re talking to a bot or navigating an IVR system. The user won\u0026rsquo;t be prompted to select one from the below options. The LLM can adapt to the conversation and provide personalized responses each time, enhancing the user experience. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to have huge set of data/ sample interactions to train the chatbots. Though they certainly be beneficial, but we can start fast, reducing the time to market. The bot can be provided with basic context and data, and it would perform quite well. This wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been possible without this open sourced LLMs. Technologies Used: LLM, Groq API, Streamlit\n🔗 GitHub 📝 Article 📱 App Link ","permalink":"https://dibyendupm.netlify.app/projects/llm-driven-hotel-booking-chatbot/","summary":"Real-time conversational booking assistant powered by Groq API and Streamlit.","title":"LLM-Driven Hotel Booking Chatbot"},{"content":"Introduction In the bustling urban landscape, efficient traffic management is crucial for the smooth functioning of cities. Traffic signal control plays a pivotal role in regulating the flow of vehicles at intersections, ensuring safety, and minimizing congestion. To address the complexities of traffic signal coordination, I introduce a web application that empowers traffic engineers and city planners to optimize signal durations based on real-time traffic flow data.\nProblem Statement Traditional traffic signal systems often operate on fixed schedules, neglecting the dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This rigidity can lead to unnecessary delays, increased fuel consumption, and heightened environmental impact. Furthermore, the lack of tools to easily customize signal durations for specific intersections and traffic conditions poses a challenge for traffic management authorities.\nSolution This web application provides a comprehensive solution to the aforementioned challenges, offering a user-friendly interface and advanced functionalities. The system allows users to define and customize traffic signal timings at a granular level, considering the number of directions, specific coordinates for each direction, and real-time traffic flow data. (This is a personal project)\nProduct Features 1. Interactive Map Selection Users can select the location of a traffic signal crossing with the help of an interactive Bing Map interface. 2. Direction Input The application guides users through the process of inputting the number of directions traffic flows across the crossing.\nEach direction is uniquely identified, allowing for precise customization.\n3. Coordinate Mapping For each direction, users can easily input \u0026ldquo;from\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; coordinates by selecting points on the map.\nThis feature streamlines the process of defining the geographic scope of each traffic flow.\n4. Cycle Time Configuration Users can set the total cycle time for the traffic signal, offering flexibility in adjusting the overall timing based on specific requirements.\nThe default cycle time is calculated as \u0026rsquo;number of directions\u0026rsquo; times 90 seconds, providing a starting point for customization.\n5. Dynamic Traffic Flow Calculation The system integrates with bing API to fetch real-time traffic flow data between specified coordinates.\nThis data is used to dynamically calculate signal durations for each direction.\n6. Result Display The application presents the calculated signal durations in a clear and concise tabular format.\nUsers can easily interpret and implement the recommended signal timings for optimized traffic management.\nConclusion This Traffic Signal Control web application serves as a foundational step towards transforming traffic management in urban environments. While the current system empowers users to optimize signal durations at a specific intersection, its potential for scalability is a key aspect that can revolutionize citywide traffic flow.\nExtending the System to Configure Citywide Traffic Lights As cities evolve, the need for comprehensive traffic management systems becomes paramount. The simplicity and effectiveness of our web application pave the way for scaling the system to configure all traffic lights within a city.
