This information enables teachers to identify areas of improvement and deliver personalized interventions.\nMy Role In my capacity as a Product Manager, I was responsible for optimizing and productising the base Khan for Educators model to align with the specific requirements of the Indian education ecosystem. This involved developing supplementary products and features to facilitate the adoption of the solution by state government education boards, enabling them to seamlessly implement it in public schools across the state.\nIn lieu of Khan Academy’s vision, “to provide a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere”, we made the strategic decision to concentrate on public schools, an untapped market with vast potential. Meanwhile, the private and paid education sector was becoming highly competitive, crowded with numerous EdTech organizations, resulting in a saturated market, often referred to as a red ocean.\nHowever, introducing our offerings to public schools through state education departments proved to be a challenging endeavor. Nevertheless, we persevered and successfully maneuvered through those obstacles along the way.\nChallenges Solutions Most public school teachers lacked the technical proficiency to self-adopt a tech driven platform 1. Built Teacher training modules, on self completion automatic certifications will be provided 2. Built Whatsapp based support chatbot to help teachers at each step of operation and to communicate with teachers to instill confidence Creating profiles of students, teachers across thousands of schools was a challenge. The existing system supported creation of profiles one-by-one at an individual level, and this method would have called for too much operational overhead. Developed a complete rostering system that incorporates UDISE and state education board data, freeing teachers of all operational work and to concentrate on what they do best- teaching. There was a lack of momentum to adopt a new system from the start. Introduced and executed LearnStorm, a campaign where completion of learning tasks is gamified, and prizes are awarded to the class with most points. over 40,000 teachers across India participated with their classes of students The Government state education board required an overview of engagement and outcome of students at multiple levels Took advantage of GCP’s integration with Google Data Studio and built actionable dashboards for the state govt education department that enabled them to track engagement and impact on real time basis. Impact Growth The entire package of solution was adopted by multiple state governments, owing to which the Monthly Active Users of Khan Academy in India grew from 50,000 to 5 lakh in one year.\nLearning Outcome Punjab - the highest adopter of the solution achieved Rank 1 amongst all states in the National Achievement Survey 2021\n",
