      <title>Authentication vs. Authorization - What’s the Difference?</title>
      <link>https://dibyendupm.com/tech-for-pm/authentication-vs-authorization-whats-the-difference/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You hear these two words thrown around all the time, and they’re almost always used together. But here’s the thing: they do two completely different jobs. Getting them right is the foundation of all digital security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the deal, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication is the bouncer at the club door checking your ID.&lt;/strong&gt;  Its only job is to answer one question:  &lt;strong&gt;“Who are you?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorization is the VIP wristband you get after you&amp;rsquo;re inside.&lt;/strong&gt;  It tells the bouncer which rooms you’re allowed into. Its job is to answer:  &lt;strong&gt;“What are you allowed to do?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication  &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;  comes first. You can&amp;rsquo;t figure out what someone is allowed to do until you know who they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. One proves your identity, the other checks your permissions. Let&amp;rsquo;s break down the most common ways apps do both.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How AI Re-Engineered Product Management</title>
      <link>https://dibyendupm.com/art-of-pm/how-ai-re-engineered-product-management/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Product Managers (PMs) used to treat AI like a distant, complex cousin – interesting if you were building the AI itself, but mostly irrelevant to the daily grind.  Now, nearly every PM is wrestling with GenAI tools, and a surprising number are even trying to build their own. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a trend; it&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental shift that&amp;rsquo;s re-engineering what it means to be a PM, all thanks to AI&amp;rsquo;s knack for demolishing the tedious, repetitive tasks that sucked the life out of our days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI ain&#39;t Magic, its Math</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s call it what it is- underneath all the glam and hype, 𝗶𝘁’𝘀 𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗵.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A network of numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patterns learned from numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spitting out more numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very simply put, it’s a complex network of if-else; running on vectors.  At least that&amp;rsquo;s where it all started, from rule based engines:&lt;/p&gt;

    An intuition for Machine Learning
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple, so what&amp;rsquo;s the path we had to cover to reach the world as we know it of LLM, GPT, autonomous agents?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons in Product Management from Game of Thrones</title>
      <link>https://dibyendupm.com/art-of-pm/lessons-in-product-management-from-game-of-thrones/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If Westeros taught us anything beyond political murder and dragons, it’s that strategy, storytelling, and ruthless clarity matter, especially when you’re shipping products instead of heirs.
Lets check some direct, and maybe sometimes uncomfortable mappings from the iconic &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; lines to what a product manager actually does and shouldn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chaos-is-a-ladder---petyr-littlefinger-baelish&#34;&gt;“Chaos is a ladder.” - Petyr ‘Littlefinger’ Baelish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://dibyendupm.com/img/chaos-is-a-ladder.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOT context:&lt;/strong&gt; Littlefinger watches disorder and uses it as opportunity to climb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-1-of-ai-aint-magic-its-math&#34;&gt;Part 1 of &amp;ldquo;AI ain&amp;rsquo;t Magic, It&amp;rsquo;s Math&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before AI became what it is today, machines behaved like bureaucrats: they only did what you explicitly told them to do.
Software was ==Rules Based==.
Meaning: you wrote conditions, and the machine reacted to those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you create the rules mentally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If  A happens then  X, If B and C happends then do Y, If A and D and E Happens then Do Z
Then hard code it&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Types of problems where ML can be applied</title>
      <link>https://dibyendupm.com/tech-for-pm/types-of-problems-where-ml-can-be-applied/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder how your email app just  &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt;  what spam is? Or how Netflix uncannily suggests the exact B-movie you were secretly in the mood for? The answer is Machine Learning (ML).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before ML, software was a bit of a bureaucrat. You had to write explicit, rigid  &lt;code&gt;if-this-then-that&lt;/code&gt;  rules for every single possibility. This works fine until the real world, in all its messy glory, shows up. ML flips the script. Instead of feeding a machine rules, you feed it  &lt;em&gt;examples&lt;/em&gt;. The machine&amp;rsquo;s job is to look at thousands or millions of examples and figure out the patterns on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A PM always pays his (Tech) Debt</title>
      <link>https://dibyendupm.com/art-of-pm/a-pm-always-pays-his-tech-debt/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-intro&#34;&gt;Some Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way. You started working and earning in your early twenties. You were basking in the glory of the newfound financial freedom. You wanted more, and hence you toiled, you learned the industry, learned about business and consumers, and slowly you moved up the ladder, earning more and more. But there was something that kept building up - Taxes and EMIs, responsibilities, deteriorating health and relationships, creeping up depressions and anxieties. You didn’t pay much attention to it earlier and didn’t invest properly (in health, wealth and relationships). Now they have started hurting you. Though the ==influx of wealth has grown, you are not able to enjoy it like you used to do. You want to go out and party, roam the world, and live carefree like you used to do, but things keeps pulling you back.==&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building a Simple Analytics Agent with MotherDuck &#43; OpenAI Agents SDK</title>
      <link>https://dibyendupm.com/tech-for-pm/simple-analytics-agent-motherduck-openai-agents-sdk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The quickest and cleanest possible way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teams today want to let non-technical users query data using plain English instead of writing SQL or dashboards. I have been playing around with multiple frameworks and techniques to achieve this, and finally I landed upon open ai agenst sdk + motherduck data warehouse, this is the quickest, cleanest, effective and at the same time thoroughly customizable way I could find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining MotherDuck’s data-warehousing power with agents that can generate and run SQL makes that possible. In this post I walk you through a minimal end-to-end example — how to wire up a simple agent that queries a database on MotherDuck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>4 Books Every Product Manager Should Read (Even If You Hate Reading Books)</title>
      <link>https://dibyendupm.com/art-of-pm/4-books-every-product-manager-should-read/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest. As a product manager, your to-do list is already miles long, and finding time to read books might seem like a luxury you can&amp;rsquo;t afford. I get it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been there too. But before you dismiss the idea completely, let me share four books that have managed to change my perspective on product management and books in general. These aren&amp;rsquo;t your typical run-of-the-mill, generic recommendations at the CEO or founder level like &amp;ldquo;Lean Product&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hooked&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Launch&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Ship it&amp;rdquo;, No. these four books provide the kind of food for thought and actionable ideas that you can start thinking about, experimenting with, and implementing right away, regardless of the stage you are currently in your product management career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
