      <description>&lt;p&gt;The word ‘Strategy’ in the business world has become almost synonymous with ‘Religion’ in general. Everyone claims they have one, everyone says their one is the right one, but very few understand what it is and a lot keep defining it in the most complex and contradictory ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our professors used to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategy is the most used and least understood word in the business world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just try to recall, how many times were you hurt to see this poor word, being beaten to death in those coveted meeting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
