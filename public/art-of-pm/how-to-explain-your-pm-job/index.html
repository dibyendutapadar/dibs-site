<p>It&rsquo;s understandable if your thoughts stall as you&rsquo;re forced to compress a highly nuanced role into something digestible for your audience.</p>
<p>Ironically, this exercise is part of the job: explaining an idea differently to various audiences (executives, department heads, stakeholders, customers, and engineers).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gathered some ideas for you to use.</p>
